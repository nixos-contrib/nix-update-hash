A GitHub Action that repairs the fixed-output hashes a dependency bump leaves
stale: `vendorHash`, `cargoHash`, `npmDepsHash`, or any other.

A Nix package built with `buildGoModule`, `buildRustPackage` or
`buildNpmPackage` pins its fetched dependencies by hash. When Dependabot bumps
`go.sum`, `Cargo.lock` or `package-lock.json`, it does not update that hash,
so `nix build` fails with a hash mismatch until someone pastes in the new one.
This action does that on the pull request instead.

## How it works

1. Builds the flake installables. If the build succeeds, there is nothing to do.
2. For each `hash mismatch in fixed-output derivation` error, it takes the
   `specified` hash and finds the one `.nix` file that holds it, then writes
   the `got` hash over it, in the same encoding (SRI, nix32, base16 or base64).
3. Builds again, in case a fixed-output derivation was only reachable once
   another one built, until the build succeeds.
4. Commits the updated files and pushes them to the checked-out branch.

The hash is found by value, not by attribute name, so it needs no
configuration per repository. Anything else that breaks the build fails the
run, as does a hash it cannot place:

- one that is computed, rather than written out as a string;
- one shared by several derivations, such as a single `lib.fakeHash`
  placeholder: give each its own;
- one that belongs to another flake input.

## Usage

```yaml
name: Update Dependency Hash

on:
  pull_request:
    paths: [go.mod, go.sum]

jobs:
  update:
    if: github.event.pull_request.user.login == 'dependabot[bot]'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
    timeout-minutes: 30
    steps:
      - name: Generate App token
        id: app-token
        uses: actions/create-github-app-token@v3
        with:
          client-id: ${{ secrets.APP_CLIENT_ID }}
          private-key: ${{ secrets.APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}

      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v7
        with:
          ref: ${{ github.head_ref }}
          token: ${{ steps.app-token.outputs.token }}

      - name: Install Nix
        uses: DeterminateSystems/nix-installer-action@v23

      - name: Update dependency hash
        uses: nixos-contrib/nix-update-hash@v1
```

For Rust, trigger on `paths: [Cargo.lock]`; for npm, on `paths: [package-lock.json]`.

Three things the workflow depends on:

- **A token that triggers workflows.** A push made with `GITHUB_TOKEN` starts
  no workflow runs, so CI would not rerun on the fixed commit. Use a GitHub App
  token, as above, or a personal access token.
- **Dependabot secrets.** Workflows Dependabot triggers cannot read Actions
  secrets. Store `APP_CLIENT_ID` and `APP_PRIVATE_KEY` as Dependabot secrets,
  at the organization or repository level.
- **The branch, not the merge commit.** `actions/checkout` checks out the
  pull request's merge commit by default, a detached `HEAD` with nowhere to
  push. Pass `ref: ${{ github.head_ref }}`.

Pair it with a ruleset that requires the build check on the default branch,
so a pull request whose hash could not be repaired waits instead of merging.

## Inputs

| Name | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `installables` | `.#default` | Space- or newline-separated flake installables to build. |
| `working-directory` | `.` | Directory to build from. Every `.nix` file under it is searched for the stale hashes. |
| `commit` | `true` | Commit the updated files and push them to the checked-out branch. Set to `false` to only update the working tree. |
| `commit-message` | `chore(nix): update dependency hash` | Message of the commit. |
| `author-name` | `github-actions[bot]` | Author and committer name of the commit. |
| `author-email` | `41898283+github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com` | Author and committer email of the commit. |

Nix must already be installed.

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| `updated` | `true` when at least one hash was updated, otherwise `false`. |
| `files` | Space-separated paths of the updated files, relative to `working-directory`. |

## Development

`tests/test.sh` runs the script against throwaway copies of
`tests/fixture`, each a git repository with a local remote, and needs only Nix:

```sh
tests/test.sh                            # every test
tests/test.sh test_updates_a_stale_hash  # one test
```
